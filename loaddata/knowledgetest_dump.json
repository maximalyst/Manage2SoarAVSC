The lowered aileron on the outside increases the angle of attack and produces more lift for that wing.

Coordinated use of rudder and aileron corrects for adverse yaw and aileron drag.<br /></p>",

If you experience symptoms of motion sickness during a lesson, you can alleviate some of the discomfort by opening fresh air vents or by focusing on objects outside the glider.

The CFRs prohibit pilots from performing crewmember duties within 8 hours after drinking any alcoholic beverage or while under the influence of alcohol. However, due to the slow destruction of alcohol, a pilot may still be under influence 8 hours after drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. <strong>Therefore, an excellent rule is to allow at least 12 to 24 hours between &ldquo;bottle and throttle,&rdquo; </strong>depending on the amount of alcoholic beverage consumed.</span></font></p></blockquote>",

    "explanation": "<p>The requirements for becoming a Duty Officer are summarized in Operations Manual Section 1.6.9, q.v. Having said THAT, it's also true that it takes considerable on-the-job training to master all the many duties of the Duty Officer (and managing the Club's logsheet program is one of the more challenging ones). Maybe someday we will have a real test for operating the Club's logsheet program (well, there's some questions on THIS program that deal with that!) because it's one of the more challenging things a Duty Officer has to learn.<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Once approved by the Chief Duty Officer, an icon will be placed on you online \"Instruction Record\" page that marks you as qualified for this position.</p>\r\n<p>You DO have to have a private pilot certificate, but also must be a Full member (meaning you've been a Probationary member for at least a year).</p>",

Answer B is incorrect because the front seat canopy is possible to get too hot when it's left open. Answer C is annoying, but not something that can cause permanent damage. Very hot belt buckles are one reason why we have silver aluminized canopy covers for both the Grob and the K-21.

Once the tow plane and glider have accelerated to the appropriate speed, the glider will very suddenly develop lift, and will balloon into the air.&nbsp; The novice pilot might not notice this until he's several feet off of the ground, and then has to take immediate action, having to dive down into position.

SSC cockpit cards are based on flying without ballast, and do not cover flight restrictions or weight and balance with ballast.<br />V. Flight with water ballast requires careful monitoring of inflight temps to avoid freezing of water in ballast tanks.<br />VI. Takeoff and landing procedures are different with water ballast.<br />VII. Internal baffling in the wings can hold water assymetrically, making takeoff difficult if not balanced.<br />VIII.
